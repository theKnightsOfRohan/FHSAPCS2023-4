     * 7. Higher dimensional geometry. Higher dimensional spaces are very important
     * in machine learning and data science. However, the geometry of higher
     * dimensions often doesnâ€™t behave the way you expect based on your intuition
     * from 2nd and 3rd dimensional spaces.
     * Generate two random points from a d-dimensional space with each coordinate
     * between 0 and 1. Calculate the average distance between them over many
     * trials.
     * 
     * Output a table showing the average distance between two random points with
     * the dimension going from 2 to 30.
     * 
     * Your table should show that as the dimension increases, most of the volume of
     * the hypercube lies near the surface. (Think about why your numbers might
     * imply this). (Whereas our intuition of a square or a cube is that most of the
     * volume lies near the middle (not the perimeter)).
